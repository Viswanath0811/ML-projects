# ???? Machine Learning Iris Flower Classification

## Overview

The project constructs a machine learning model to predict iris flowers as one of three species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — using their petal and sepal measurements.

The model uses the historical Iris dataset and a Random Forest Classifier to classify iris flowers with very high accuracy.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Performs feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Trains a Random Forest model
- Checks model performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Saves the trained model and scaler to use for future predictions
- Includes a sample prediction script to classify new data points
